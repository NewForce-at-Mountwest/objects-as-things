// Back to the coffee shop example!

// Define a couple of objects that represent coffee drinks


// Define a bigger object that represents the coffee shop as a whole
// It should have a property called "menu" that holds an array of the coffee drink objects we just made


// How can we change the data in an object? Say we want to change the coffee shop's open hours? Or add something to the menu?

// The current values in an object are called the object's "state". The state can change!

// Methods can also accept parameters!
